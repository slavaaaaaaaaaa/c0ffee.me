title: "Viewing the contents of a zip as a tree"
---

I was building some jar's for a Jenkins shared pipeline and trying to validate what files/folders were included in the result. Normally I use the `tree` command to inspect directories like this, as it makes more visual sense to me. However to view the contents of a zip we have to do something like `unzip -l filename.zip` which gives us a pretty verbose and difficult to understand result (at least to me).

## Solution

Add a the following function to my ~/.zshrc

```bash
function tree() {
	arr=( "${@}" )
	if ( file $arr[-1] | grep -q 'Zip archive' ) ; then
		tar tf $arr[-1] | tree ${arr[@]:0:-1} --fromfile .
	else
		command tree $@
	fi
}
```

Now we can `tree somefolder` just as well as `tree somejar.jar`, or any other Zip archive! For example:

```bash
» tree ~/.m2/repository/org/testng/testng/6.13.1/testng-6.13.1.jar
.
