title: "Viewing the contents of a zip as a tree"
---

I was building some jar's for a Jenkins shared pipeline and trying to validate what files/folders were included in the result. Normally I use the `tree` command to inspect directories like this, as it makes more visual sense to me. However to view the contents of a zip we have to do something like `unzip -l filename.zip` which gives us a pretty verbose and difficult to understand result (at least to me).

## Solution

Use [treeify](https://bitbucket.org/Hakril/treeify/src/master/)<sup>[(citation)[https://superuser.com/a/1086525]]</sup> and zsh aliases so i can `tree filename.jar`

1. Make treeify part of your path, e.g.

```bash
curl https://bitbucket.org/Hakril/treeify/raw/8e732368f64d30ffc4033cbc890164fdf296d9f8/treeify.py -O /usr/bin/treeify && chmod +x /usr/bin/treeify
```

2. Add a the following function to my ~/.zshrc

```bash
function tree() {
	if ( file $@[-1] | grep -q 'Zip archive' ) ; then
		unzip -Z1 $@[-1] | treeify
	else
		command tree $@
	fi
}
```

Now we can `tree somefolder` just as well as `tree somejar.jar`, or any other Zip archive! For example:

```bash
» tree ~/.m2/repository/org/testng/testng/6.13.1/testng-6.13.1.jar
.
